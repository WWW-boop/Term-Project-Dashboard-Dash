# Dashboard Predict PM 2.5 ðŸ¤§

This project utilizes Dash for creating a web-based dashboard and PyCaret for predictive modeling of PM 2.5 levels.

## Introduction
This dashboard aims to provide insights and predictions regarding PM 2.5 levels. PM 2.5 refers to particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller



## Features
- Data Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs to visualize historical PM 2.5 levels.
- Predictive Modeling: Utilizes PyCaret library to build predictive models for forecasting PM 2.5 levels.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Dash
- Pandas
- PyCaret

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/WWW-boop/Term-Project-Dashboard-Dash.git
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application
    ```
    python main.py
## Usage

1. Upon accessing the dashboard, you will be presented with visualizations of historical PM 2.5 data.
2. To make predictions, navigate to the prediction section and input the required parameters.
3. The model will generate predictions for future PM 2.5 levels based on the provided inputs.


## Data Source
The PM 2.5 data used in this project is obtained from [Air4Thai](http://air4thai.pcd.go.th/), which is the official website of the Pollution Control Department (PCD) of Thailand. The data is collected from various monitoring stations across Thailand.
